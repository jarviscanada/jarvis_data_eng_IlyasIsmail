      "description": "Collaborated with a team of four to develop a cloud-hosted web application and an accompanying mobile application over four months. Customers could search for books based on filters such as genre or title and were able to add books to their shopping cart. Admins were able to apply CRUD functions on books for maintenance. We implemented the app using the MERN stack alongside libraries such as Axios, JWT, and bcrypt for connection requests and authentication, Bootstrap for better front-end visualization, and Nodemailer to send e-mails. We hosted the web app online through Heroku and the mobile app through Google Firebase. The mobile app made requests directly to and from the web app's API. Testing was done through manual testing of each feature.",

      "description": "Developed an MvC ASP.NET web application that allowed users to register, log in, and upload or edit their video files for other users to download and comment on to leave a review. The uploader would provide the title, genre, description, and release date of the video. The other two columns, uploader, and ratings, are automatically generated based on other values such as the uploader's account name and the comments provided. Other users can comment on videos and leave a rating out of ten, the average rating of the video is the video's overall rating. DynamoDB was used to store all the text values for every movie object. Amazon S3 was used to store and download the video files. Elastic Beanstalk was used to host the application online.",

All controllers had CRUD features implemented, however, books also allowed the librarian to view which books were available and which books were loaned out. Maven was used for build automation, to get all the required packages. MySQL was used to store the data for all three models. Apache Tomcat was used to locally host the application.",

A PostgreSQL Docker container was created to host the database. Bash was used to retrieve the information needed through commands such as vmstat for memory, IO, and CPU usage statistics, df for available disk space, date for the current date in a specific format, and lscpu to retrieve the CPU's hardware details. The script responsible for collecting the system's resource usage was automated using a cron job that would run every minute. Testing was completed manually, running the script on a single machine, and debugging based on any errors thrown. Git and GitHub were used for version control using the GitFlow branching model.",

I'm an experienced Java and web developer who has built multiple Spring Boot applications, such as a library management tool for librarians to maintain their customers, books, and transactions in a MySQL database through CRUD features. I've also designed and developed ASP.NET and MERN-based web applications, such as a book store that allowed users to browse for books stored on a MongoDB database based on their search filter and add it to their cart for check-out. To summarize, I'm looking to put my experience and skills to good use in the software development industry."
