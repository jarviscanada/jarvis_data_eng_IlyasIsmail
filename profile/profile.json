      "description": "Collaborated with a team of four to develop a cloud-hosted web application and an accompanying mobile application over four months. We implemented the app using the MERN stack alongside libraries such as Axios, JWT, and bcrypt for connection requests and authentication, Bootstrap for better front-end visualization, and Nodemailer to send e-mails. We hosted the web app online and had the mobile app make requests directly to and from the web app's API. Testing was done through manual testing of each feature. The applications were deployed through Heroku and Google's Firebase.",

Implementation was done with MongoDB as the database, Node.js and Express.js as the back-end, EJS and Bootstrap for front-end visualization, bcrypt for encryption, Nodemailer to send verification e-mails, and Chai for unit testing. Testing was performed manually at times and through utilizing Chai towards the end of development. Deployment was done through Heroku, where the web application was hosted online.",

A PostgreSQL Docker container was created to host the database. Bash was used to retrieve the information needed through commands such as vmstat, date, and lscpu. Testing was completed manually, running the script on a single machine and debugging as necessary. Regarding deployment, the database was deployed through a PostgreSQL Docker container, the automation was set using a crontab task, and the code was deployed to a cloud repository using Git and GitHub.",
