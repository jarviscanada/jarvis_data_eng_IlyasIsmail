    description: Implemented scripts and a database to track and store system specifications and resource usage to assist system administrators with maintaining system performance and faulty hardware. A PostgreSQL Docker container was created to host the database. Bash was used to retrieve the information needed through commands such as vmstat, date, and lscpu. Testing was completed manually, running the script on a single machine and debugging as necessary. Regarding deployment, the database was deployed through a PostgreSQL Docker container, the automation was set using a crontab task, and the code was deployed to a cloud repository using Git and GitHub.

    description: Collaborated with a team of four to develop a cloud-hosted web application and an accompanying mobile application over four months. We implemented the app using the MERN stack alongside libraries such as Axios, JWT, and bcrypt for connection requests and authentication, Bootstrap for better front-end visualization, and Nodemailer to send e-mails. We hosted the web app online and had the mobile app make requests directly to and from the web app's API. Testing was done through manual testing of each feature. The applications were deployed through Heroku and Google's Firebase.
  - name: "Restaurant Web App"
    git_url: "https://github.com/COMP231Team/GrabATable"
    description: Developed a web app, alongside nine team members, for restaurant owners to list their establishments on our site and for customers to book seats at the restaurant with confirmation. Implementation was done with MongoDB as the database, Node.js and Express.js as the back-end, EJS and Bootstrap for front-end visualization, bcrypt for encryption, Nodemailer to send verification e-mails, and Chai for unit testing. Testing was performed manually at times and through utilizing Chai towards the end of development. Deployment was done through Heroku, where the web application was hosted online.
